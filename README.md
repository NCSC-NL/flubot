# Flubot DGA

This repository contains lists of domains generated by the Flubot DGA.

## Flubot 4.7

Flubot v4.7 has slightly altered the DGA where it's no longer selecting a seed value based on the phone number's country code. Instead, it will randomly select a seed value from this list: 1136, 1642, 1813, 1945, 2931.
The files in this repository generated for newer versions will henceforth incorporate the Flubot version instead of the seed value. Such as: `flubot_v4.7_202107.txt`.

## Older versions (Flubot <= 4.6)
The lists with an explicit seed value (like `flubot_2931_202107.txt`) are generated for all currently known seeds, as of Flubot v4.6.
The actual seed value as used per country might differ between earlier releases:

| Seed value | Country code(s)            |
|------------|----------------------------|
| 1136       | ES (default)               |
| 1642       | UK                         |
| 1813       | IT                         |
| 1905       | JP                         |
| 1945       | AT, CH, DE                 |
| 2931       | NL, PL, NO, FI, ES, DK, BE |
